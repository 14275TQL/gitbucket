# Contrib Notes #
RedHat directory also contains scripts for Ubuntu, and the configuration adapts according to the OS.
Ideally the Mac scripts would also be folded in as well.

This version of scripts has so far only been tested on Ubuntu. I'll test on Mac also, but someone else will have to test on RedHat.
