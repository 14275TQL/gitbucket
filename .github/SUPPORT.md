# The support guidelines

- At first, see [Wiki](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/wiki) and check issues whether there is a same question or request in the past.
- If you can't find same question and report, send it to [gitter room](https://gitter.im/gitbucket/gitbucket) before raising an issue.
- We can also support in Japanese other than English at [gitter room for Japanese](https://gitter.im/gitbucket/gitbucket_ja).
- Write an issue in English. Since we can't support issues written in other languages, we close them forcibly.
